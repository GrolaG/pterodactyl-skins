# Pterodactyl Skins

Made this mainly for https://dino.gg (cridents' gamepanel) but it should work on every other since most are still on AdminLTE. Although there are features u can remove that are gamepanel.co specific such as notifications and other stuff that might not suit your panel.
Even though this is only like a couple CSS files pls don't skid and pull the "I made it :reddit_smile:" meme thnx.

# Installing

I include tamper monkey userscripts w/ every theme so just pop that into your tamper monkey (or whatever u use if it supports userscript) and it'll work.
