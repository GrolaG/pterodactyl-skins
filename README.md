# Pterodactyl Skins

I made a buncha skins for my favorite gamepanel.
Most of them where made to support Cridents' https://gamepanel.co/ panel, which is Pterodactyl but heavily modified with a bunch of cool new features that the original Pterodactyl doesn't have.

That being said, don't make issues if it's not working for your panel, this is really just for gamepanel.co users and others who may know how to modify it to use it on other pterodactyl panels. (Although it shouldn't necessarily break on any other panel)

# Installing

I include tamper monkey userscripts w/ every theme so just pop that into your tamper monkey (or whatever u use if it supports userscript) and it'll work.
